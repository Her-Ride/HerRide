# HerRide backend (placeholder)

This folder contains a minimal TypeScript + Express skeleton intended as a starting point. It is intentionally small and used for local development and demonstrating how a backend could be added to the monorepo.

Quick commands (run from `backend/`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # start with ts-node-dev
npm run build  # compile to dist/
npm start      # run compiled build
```
